# 🌟 My Cozy Arch Linux EassyManager

Welcome to my personal dotfiles collection! These configurations have been carefully crafted to create a comfortable and efficient Arch Linux environment, built on top of the amazing [HyprDots](https://github.com/prasanthrangan/hyprdots) foundation. Feel free to explore and use anything that catches your eye! ✨

## 🎨 Base Configuration - HyprDots

This configuration uses [HyprDots](https://github.com/prasanthrangan/hyprdots) as its foundation, which provides:

- **Hyprland** - A dynamic tiling Wayland compositor
- **Waybar** - Highly customizable status bar
- **Rofi** - Application launcher and menu system
- **Dunst** - Lightweight notification daemon
- **Swaylock** - Screen locker for Wayland
- **Wlogout** - Logout menu for Wayland

## 🐱 KittyDOTS Customizations

On top of HyprDots, I've added my personal configurations for:

- **Hyprland** - Custom keybindings and window rules
- **Kitty** - The snappiest terminal emulator around
- **Neovim** - Because life's too short for nano
- **Yazi** - Modern terminal-based file manager
- **Fish** - Modern and user-friendly shell
- **MPV** - High-performance media player
- **Custom Scripts** - Quality of life improvements

## 🚀 Installation

1. First, install HyprDots following their [official installation guide](https://github.com/prasanthrangan/hyprdots#installation)

2. Then, clone and install KittyDOTS:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/dotfiles.git ~/.KittyDOTS
cd ~/.KittyDOTS
./install.sh
```

The install script will symlink everything to its proper location, carefully merging with HyprDots configurations. Don't worry - it'll backup your existing configs first!

## 📦 Additional Dependencies

Beyond HyprDots requirements, you'll need:

```bash
yay -S kitty fish neovim yazi mpv fzf nerd-fonts-complete
```

## ⚙️ Post-Install Setup

1. Switch to Fish shell: `chsh -s /usr/bin/fish`
2. Set up Neovim plugins: `nvim +PackerSync`
3. Log out and back in
4. Enjoy your new setup!
